# 🚀 AI OS - Deployment Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

Your AI OS project has been successfully created and is ready for deployment!

**Repository Details:**
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/Manasvi-1/ai-os
- **Clone URL**: https://github.com/Manasvi-1/ai-os.git
- **SSH URL**: git@github.com:Manasvi-1/ai-os.git

## 📋 Manual Git Push Instructions

Since the repository is already created, you'll need to manually push your code. Here's how:

### 1. Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add all files to Git
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Create initial commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI OS - Neural Desktop Environment

- Complete AI-enhanced web-based Linux operating system
- Features: AI Terminal, AI Assistant, Intelligent File Manager, AI Code Editor
- Built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API
- Real-time communication via WebSocket
- Secure authentication and permission system
- Professional-grade architecture with modern tech stack"
```

### 4. Add GitHub repository as remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manasvi-1/ai-os.git
```

### 5. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If you encounter any issues, you can also use:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
Your project is already running on Replit and can be easily deployed:

1. **Current URL**: Your project is accessible at the Replit URL
2. **Deploy Button**: Click the "Deploy" button in Replit to make it publicly accessible
3. **Custom Domain**: Configure a custom domain through Replit's deployment settings

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Netlify Deployment
```bash
npm run build
# Upload the dist folder to Netlify
```

### Option 4: Railway Deployment
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
REPLIT_DOMAINS=your_deployment_domain
```

## 📈 Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Test AI features (Terminal, Assistant, Code Editor)
- [ ] Confirm user authentication works
- [ ] Check WebSocket real-time features
- [ ] Validate file management operations
- [ ] Test system monitoring dashboard

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set
   - Ensure PostgreSQL server is accessible
   - Check firewall settings

2. **AI Features Not Working**
   - Confirm OPENAI_API_KEY is valid
   - Check OpenAI API quota and billing
   - Verify network connectivity to OpenAI servers

3. **Authentication Problems**
   - Ensure REPLIT_DOMAINS matches your deployment domain
   - Check SESSION_SECRET is properly configured
   - Verify OAuth callback URLs
